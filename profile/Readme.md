## Introducing APAD

APAD (Air Pollution Asset Database) is an innovative approach to monitor air pollution sources, providing valuable insights for governments, financial institutes, and the public. Our mission is to address the critical issue of air pollution by providing comprehensive data and facilitating informed decision-making towards improving air quality.

### Who We Are

At APAD, we believe that clean air is a fundamental human right essential for wellbeing, ecosystems, and sustainable development. Unfortunately, a significant portion of the global population lacks access to clean air, leading to severe health and environmental consequences. Despite the alarming statistics, there is a lack of adequate funding directed towards air quality improvement initiatives, particularly in low and middle-income countries.

- **99% of the world's population** does not have access to clean air.
- **7 million people** die due to air pollution every year.
- **$12.5 billion/year** on average, is allocated to outdoor air pollution funding projects.

### Our Story

The inspiration behind APAD stems from the dire need to address the challenges posed by air pollution, especially in regions like the Indo-Gangetic Plain. With sparse data points and inadequate air quality monitoring infrastructure in place, it becomes challenging to allocate resources effectively towards air quality control measures. APAD aims to bridge this gap by creating a comprehensive asset database and driving initiatives for positive change.

## ASSET DATABASE

### Pollution Source Database

We have developed an asset-level database that provides detailed information about various pollution sources, including agriculture, industries, road and rail infrastructure, and more. Our database offers high-resolution, geo-located assets with data on quantity, non-greenhouse gas pollutants, emissions, and other relevant information. This database serves as a valuable resource for making informed decisions to mitigate air pollution.

## AIR QUALITY INITIATIVES

### How We Drive Change

The Indo-Gangetic Plain faces critical air quality challenges, impacting millions of lives. Financing air quality initiatives in this region is not only an environmental imperative but also a health necessity. APAD advocates for investments in sustainable practices, clean energy, and pollution control technologies to significantly improve life quality and ensure the region's ecological and economic resilience.

## STAKEHOLDERS

### Who Do We Provide Value To

APAD provides value to a wide range of stakeholders, including governments, industries, financial institutions, and the public. Our work is aimed at creating a positive impact on the environment, public health, and the economy. By collaborating with various stakeholders, we envision a world where everyone has the right to breathe clean air.
